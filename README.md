#Traders for Effective Altruism

If you are reading this chances are that you love trading as much as we do. 

We have created this project with two main goals:

1. To build a community of traders which also happen to be interested in altruism. 
2. To raise awareness about the Effective Altruism movement, the EA Funds and other EA organizations.

What is Effective altruism?

Effective altruism is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to help others the most?

Rather than just doing what feels right, EA uses evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on.

What are the Effective Altruism Funds?

The Effective Altruism Funds have been designed  to help individuals give in a way that is both effective and convenient. It's kind of like a mutual fund, but for maximizing the effectiveness of your donations, rather than your investment returns.

How can I collaborate to the project?

You can directly donate a part of your trading profits to the Effective Altruism Fund of your preference or you can support the project by simply adding to your tweets the hashtag #EATraders. By doing so, we will be able to retweet the charts so everyone can benefit from your expertise.

Who is behind this project?

I´m a 42 years old effective altruist and a trader that has chosen the option Earn to Give as a life choice. You can read more about Earn to Give here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give and here https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/.

So far I have a registry of my direct donations to the Against Malaria Foundation here: https://www.AgainstMalaria.com/EffectiveAltruismTrader

Why have you chosen AMF as your main cause?

The Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) is one of GiveWell´s top-rated charities and I believe that it offers donors an outstanding opportunity to accomplish good with my donations.
