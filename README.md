If you are reading this chances are that you love trading as much as we do. 

I have created this project with two main goals:

1. To build a <a href="https://twitter.com/eatraders">community of traders</a> which also happen to be interested in altruism. 
2. To raise awareness about the Effective Altruism movement, the EA Funds and other EA organizations.

It is a personal project only for educational purposes and not financial advice. 

How to collaborate:   

1. Donate part of your trading profits to the <a href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds">Effective Altruism Funds</a> 
2. Add to your tweets the hashtag #EATraders
3. Find Peer-to-Peer funding opportunities at our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/eatraders">Facebook group</a>.

<b>What is Effective Altruism?</b>  

<a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective altruism</a> is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to help others the most?

Rather than just doing what feels right, EA uses evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on.

<b>What are the Effective Altruism Funds?</b>

The <a href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds">Effective Altruism Funds</a> have been designed  to help individuals give in a way that is both effective and convenient. It's kind of like a mutual fund, but for maximizing the effectiveness of your donations, rather than your investment returns.

<b>How can I collaborate?</b>

You can directly donate part of your trading profits to the <a href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/global-development">Effective Altruism Fund</a> of your preference or you can support the project by simply adding to your tweets the hashtag <b>#EATraders</b>. 

By doing so, we will be able to retweet your charts so everyone in the community can benefit from your expertise.

<b>Who is behind this project?</b>

IÂ´m a 42 years old effective altruist and a trader that has chosen the option <b>Earn to Give</b> as a life choice. You can read more about Earn to Give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give">here</a> and <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/">here</a>.

If you want to learn more, thereÂ´s a registry of my personal donations to the <b>Against Malaria Foundation</b> <a href="https://www.AgainstMalaria.com/EffectiveAltruismTrader">here</a>.

<b>Why have you chosen AMF as your main cause?</b>

The Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) is one of <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWellÂ´s top-rated charities</a> and I believe that it offers donors an outstanding opportunity to accomplish good with my donations.

<b>Where can I find you?</b>

<b>Where can I learn to trade?</b>

If youÂ´d like to learn a reliable strategy to trade Stocks, FX, Futures or Crypto markets, I highly recommend the <a href="http://22s.com/023174/knm5">trading group</a> Nic runs on Facebook. The strategy she uses works on any trending market and its simplicity and reliability has completely change the view I previously had about TA. <a href="http://22s.com/023174/knm5">Subscribe here</a> and IÂ´ll donate any profit I make through the referral link.
